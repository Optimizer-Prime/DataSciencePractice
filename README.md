- Deep Learning 1
  - The notebooks listed here are based on part 1 of the course. They may include additional cells from me trying different models, learning rates, image sizes, transforms, etc. All of these notebooks were run in Jupyter Lab on my local machine in an Anaconda environment set up for deep learning work. The times shown for training correlate to a GTX 1080TI GPU if you were curious.
  
  - FastaiDL1Practice_MNISTdigits.ipynb - Practice image classification on MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
  - FastaiDL1Practice_Pets.ipynb - From lesson 1, classifies breed of cats and dogs.
  - FastaiDL1Practice_DatasetsfromImages.ipynb - Classifies different images pulled from image search, in this case lions, tigers, and cheetahs. Achieved 0.008333 error rate (99.17% accuracy).
  - FastaiDL1Practice_Multilabel_Planets.ipynb - Classifies images with multiple labels per image. Uses planets dataset from Kaggle.
  - FastaiDL1Practice_ImageSegmentation.ipynb - Uses CamVid dataset.
  - FastaiDL1Practice_HeadPose.ipynb - Estimates the center of the face for various head poses. Uses BIWI dataset.
  - FastaiDL1Practice_IMDB.ipynb - A sentiment analysis NLP model based on up to 100,000 IMDB movie reviews.
